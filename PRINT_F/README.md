## 🛠️ Features

The **FT_PRINTF** function supports the following format specifiers:

- **`%c`**: Prints a single character.
- **`%s`**: Prints a string of characters.
- **`%d` / `%i`**: Prints a signed integer in decimal format.
- **`%x` / `%X`**: Prints an unsigned integer in hexadecimal format (lowercase/uppercase).
- **`%p`**: Prints a pointer address.
- **`%%`**: Prints a literal percent sign.

All features are implemented with precision to mimic the behavior of the original `printf` function as closely as possible.
